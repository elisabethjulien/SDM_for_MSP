1. Ecological data processing

Following (xxx) methodology, selected speciesâ€™ distribution records were distributed from Global Biodiversity Information Facility (gbif.org) and OBIS (obis.org) open access repositories. Data was handled in  R (4.2.3) using packages xxx to eliminate duplicates, na data, low coordinate precision, name adjustments. A sea mask is applied to filter out illogical occurrences (on land). Data is geographically filtered to 5x5km to reduce spatial autocorrelation and environmental redundancy in the data (Valera et al., 2014). Species-specific data is added, such as distribution in the water column use (benthic/demersal/pelagic) and distribution scale (global/ regional).
