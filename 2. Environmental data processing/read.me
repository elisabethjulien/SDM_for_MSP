2. Environmental data processing

Here, we use environmental variable data sourced from Bio-ORACLE website (www.bio-oracle.org) and depth data from gebco.net (which we then preprocessed in QGis). We select relevant geospatial scenarios, analyse and filter for collinearity, and create rasterStacks to use in SDM.
