## Abstract
Keywords: Climate Change, Marine Spatial Planning, Species Distribution Modelling, Portugal

Human activities and climate change threaten ecosystem sustainability, affecting both wildlife and human populations. Integrating climate change knowledge into marine spatial planning (MSP) is necessary to support ecosystem-based, forward-looking management and develop climate resilience. Using species distribution models (SDMs), we project climate change effects on various Portuguese maritime uses, as a first assessment of climate resilience of Portuguese MSP. Seventy-two (highly diverse) marine species were selected as proxies for main human uses of the ocean (conservation, fisheries, aquaculture, tourism and recreation). Models were fitted with eleven statistical techniques and ensembles were run under two representative climate scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). Models show drastic loss of habitat suitability across the Portuguese maritime area in the near future (2050s and 2090s). Our projections allow for preliminary identification of  key areas of interest for MSP in Portugal, from cross-sector risks to opportunities, and we suggest future directions to support the implementation of a climate-smart approach to Portuguese MSP.
